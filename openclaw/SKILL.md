# Section 11 — AI Coaching Protocol

## First Use Setup

On first use:

1. **Check for DOSSIER.md** in the workspace
   - If not found, fetch template from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrankAddict/section-11/main/DOSSIER_TEMPLATE.md
   - Ask the athlete to fill in their data (zones, goals, schedule, etc.)
   - Save as DOSSIER.md in the workspace

2. **Set up JSON data source**
   - Athlete creates a private GitHub repo for training data
   - Set up automated sync from Intervals.icu to `latest.json`
   - Save the raw URL in DOSSIER.md under "Data Source"
   - See: https://github.com/CrankAddict/section-11#2-set-up-your-data-mirror-optional-but-recommended

3. **Configure heartbeat settings**
   - Fetch template from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrankAddict/section-11/main/HEARTBEAT_TEMPLATE.md
   - Ask athlete for their specific values:
     - Location for weather checks (city/area)
     - Timezone
     - Valid outdoor riding hours
     - Weather thresholds (min temp, max wind, max rain %)
     - Preferred notification hours
   - Save as HEARTBEAT.md in the workspace

Do not proceed with coaching until dossier, data source, and heartbeat config are complete.

## Protocol

Fetch and follow: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrankAddict/section-11/main/SECTION_11.md

## Data Hierarchy
1. JSON data (always fetch first from athlete's data URL)
2. Protocol rules (SECTION_11.md)
3. Athlete dossier (DOSSIER.md)
4. Heartbeat config (HEARTBEAT.md)

## Required Actions
- Fetch latest.json before any training question
- No virtual math — use only fetched values
- Follow Section 11 B validation checklist
- Cite frameworks per protocol

## Heartbeat Operation

On each heartbeat, follow the checks and scheduling rules defined in your HEARTBEAT.md:
- Daily: training/wellness observations, weather (only if conditions are good)
- Weekly: background analysis, sports science review
- Self-schedule next heartbeat with randomized timing within notification hours
