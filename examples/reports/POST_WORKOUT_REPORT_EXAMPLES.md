Interpretation:
Interval targets met — all three efforts within ±3W of prescribed power. Z3 at 3% is
from warm-up/cool-down transitions, not drift. Decoupling 3.82% across interval session is
acceptable. TSB at -11.40 reflects build week loading. Recovery spin tomorrow. 🔄

## Example 3: Shortened Session (Modified)

```
Data (last_updated UTC: 2026-01-20T12:48:55)

Endurance ride cut short at 1.5h of planned 2.5h due to knee discomfort. SkiErg skipped.

Start time: 10:02:18
Duration: 1.50 hours (planned 2.5h)
Distance: 45.1 km

EF: 1.29
Variability Index: 1.01 (good)
Calories: 800 kcal
Carbs used: 153 g
TSS: 47 (planned 78)

Skipped workout: VirtualSki Training Session
Reason: Precautionary — knee discomfort from ride

Weekly totals:
Polarization: Z1+Z2 98%, Z3 0%, Z4+ 2%
Durability: 1.92% 7d mean(2) / 2.40% 28d mean(10) (improving)
EF: 1.41 7d mean(3) / 1.42 28d mean(12) (stable)

ATL: 68.15
Ramp rate: -0.30
ACWR: 0.97 (optimal)
Recovery Index: 0.95
Hours: 4.25
TSS: 132

Interpretation:
Session cut short — right call given the knee discomfort. Aerobic quality during the 1.5h
was excellent (decoupling 1.92%, VI 1.00). TSS 47 vs planned 78 means a lighter day than
intended. Monitor knee before tomorrow's session. If persistent, consider swapping to
upper-body only. 🩹

Interpretation:
Easy recovery walk, entirely in Z1 as expected on a rest day. TSB positive at +0.85 —
recovering well heading into tomorrow's interval session. Braved the rain at 4°C too. 🌧️
